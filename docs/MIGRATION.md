# Migration Guide

> **Arkalia CIA** - Documentation restructuring and architectural changes

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive documentation modernization and architectural clarifications implemented in the project.

## Documentation Restructure

### Archived Legacy Documents

The following documents have been moved to `docs/archive/` to eliminate architectural contradictions:

| Document | Reason for Archival |
|----------|-------------------|
| `PLAN_VOCAL_2MIN.md` | Outdated planning document |
| `GUIDE_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE1.md` | Superseded by current documentation |
| `PLAN_ACTION_COMPLET.md` | Conflicting architectural decisions |

### New Documentation Structure

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Project overview
â”œâ”€â”€ ARCHITECTURE.md              # Technical architecture with Mermaid diagrams
â”œâ”€â”€ API.md                       # Comprehensive API reference
â”œâ”€â”€ DEPLOYMENT.md                # Production deployment procedures
â”œâ”€â”€ CONTRIBUTING.md              # Development standards and workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md                 # Version history and changes
â”œâ”€â”€ MIGRATION.md                 # This document
â””â”€â”€ SECURITY.md                  # Security policies (root level)
```

## Architectural Clarifications

### Before: Inconsistent Architecture
- Mixed client-server and local-first approaches
- Scattered documentation with contradictions
- Multiple plans with conflicting objectives

### After: Unified Local-First Architecture
- Clear local-first strategy with progressive enhancement
- Unified professional documentation
- Coherent 3-phase development plan

## Development Phases

### âœ… Phase 1: Local MVP (Completed)
- 100% local mobile application
- Native API integration (calendar, contacts)
- No network dependencies
- Secure local storage with AES-256 encryption

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Completed)
- Advanced local functionality
- Voice recognition capabilities
- System widgets integration
- Senior-friendly UX optimization

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Connected Ecosystem (Planned)
- Optional cloud synchronization
- Backend Python service reuse
- Secure family sharing
- Robot integration (Reachy Mini)

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality Standards
- **Formatting**: Black + Ruff for Python, Dart format for Flutter
- **Linting**: Comprehensive code analysis
- **Testing**: 66% coverage with unit and integration tests
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning

### CI/CD Enhancements
- âœ… 100% passing GitHub Actions workflows
- âœ… Automated security scanning
- âœ… Cross-platform testing
- âœ… Code quality validation

## Migration for Developers

### Required Actions

1. **Review Updated Documentation**
   - Read the new [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - Understand the local-first approach
   - Follow the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines

2. **Update Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Update Flutter SDK
   flutter upgrade

   # Update Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Setup pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Code Adaptation**
   - Follow new coding standards
   - Use updated API patterns
   - Implement proper error handling

### Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a documentation and architectural clarification update that maintains backward compatibility.

### New Requirements

| Component | Previous | Current | Notes |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------|
| Flutter | 3.0+ | 3.35.3+ | Latest stable version |
| Python | 3.8+ | 3.10+ | Enhanced type support |
| Dependencies | Mixed versions | Latest secure | Security updates |

## Benefits of New Structure

### 1. Consistency
- Single source of truth for architecture
- Unified terminology and concepts
- Clear development roadmap

### 2. Professional Standards
- Industry-standard documentation format
- Comprehensive API reference
- Production-ready deployment guides

### 3. Developer Experience
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Standardized code quality
- Automated testing and validation

### 4. Security
- Comprehensive security policy
- Vulnerability reporting procedures
- Automated security scanning

## FAQ

### Q: Why the local-first architecture?
**A**: Patricia needs a simple, reliable app that works on her phone without internet dependency. This approach ensures maximum simplicity and reliability.

### Q: What happens to the existing Python backend?
**A**: The backend is preserved and will be utilized in Phase 3 for synchronization and family sharing features. No work is lost.

### Q: How do I contribute to the new structure?
**A**: Follow the updated [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide and respect the local-first architectural principles.

### Q: Are there any breaking changes?
**A**: No breaking changes in functionality. Only documentation and development workflow improvements.

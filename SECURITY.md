### Security Advisories

We publish security advisories for all significant vulnerabilities:

- **Location**: [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/arkalia-luna-system/arkalia-cia/security/advisories)
- **Format**: CVE-compatible notifications
- **Distribution**: GitHub notifications, email alerts

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

```markdown
✅ **Recommended Practices**
- Keep the app updated to the latest version
- Use device lock (PIN/biometric) protection
- Enable automatic security updates
- Report suspicious behavior immediately
- Use official app stores only

❌ **Avoid These Risks**
- Installing from unofficial sources
- Sharing device access credentials
- Disabling security features
- Using public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations
```

### For Developers

```markdown
✅ **Secure Coding Guidelines**
- Validate all input data
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow least privilege principle
- Regular dependency updates

❌ **Security Anti-patterns**
- Hardcoded secrets in code
- Insufficient input validation
- Unencrypted sensitive data
- Overprivileged access
- Outdated dependencies
```
